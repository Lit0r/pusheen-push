# pusheen-push
Why push when you can Pusheen?

Currently intended support:
git and mercurial

Supported: git

setup:
<git|hg>_pusheen_setup.sh
or add an alias to "<this folder>/push.sh <git|hg>" in the appropriate config 
file yourself.

use:

git push [args] 
hg push [args]

becomes

git pusheen [args]
hg pusheen [args]

and you get pusheen if the push didn't have errors (for now).

upcoming:
more pusheens

I don't own any rights to Pusheen (Pusheen Corp. does, http://pusheen.com) but
I hope this counts as fair use!
