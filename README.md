# pusheen-push
Why push when you can Pusheen?


Want more Pusheen in your life? (duh. of course.)

Like source control? (is that even a question?)

Well, now you can have both at once! Pushing a bux fix is much more rewarding
with a cute cat at the end of it.


Supported source control:
git, mercurial

Supported OS:
Mac and Linux

setup:
<git|hg>_pusheen_setup.sh

or add an alias to "<this folder>/push.sh <git|hg>" in the appropriate config 
file yourself. Chances are you already know how to do this, or know how to ask
the internet for the answer :)

You should only have to run setup once for it to take effect.

The setup files will add a pusheen alias to the config file in your home folder,
and will apply to any repo, given you act as the same user.

use:

git push [args] 

becomes

git pusheen [args]

and

hg push [args]

becomes

hg pusheen [args]

and you get Pusheen if the push didn't have errors (for now).

upcoming:
more Pusheens!!!

I don't own any rights to Pusheen (Pusheen Corp. does, http://pusheen.com) but
I made all of the ASCII art of Pusheen in this project (hopefully) in the 
likeness of pusheen.
