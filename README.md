#Why push when you can _pusheen_?

Want more Pusheen in your life? _duh. of course._

Like source control? _is that even a question?_

Well, now you can have both at once! Pushing a bux fix is much more rewarding
with a cute cat at the end of it.

#Support

This should work with mercurial or git, running on either mac or linux.

#Setup

For git:
    
    cd /this/is/a/path/pusheen-push
    ./git_pusheen_setup.sh

For mercurial:
    
    cd /this/is/a/path/pusheen-push
    ./hg_pusheen_setup.sh

and that's it!

#Use

Just use 'pusheen' in place of 'push', leaving all arguments intact.

Like so:

    this-is-a-shell-prompt$ git pusheen -f

#Notes

These scripts will add an alias to ~/.gitconfig or ~/.hgrc, so that it will work
on all repositories. 

If for some unknown reason you don't want this anymore, you just need to remove 
the 'pusheen = .....' line from ~/.gitconfig or ~/.hgrc, and the effect will go 
away.

You can always put the alias in other git/mercurial configuration files as well!
The setup scripts I provided are merely a convenience.

_Why am I entering my password into your script?!_

The script acts as a wrapper for 'git/hg push', so it acts just like a normal
push, minus the pusheen bit. The wrapper code (in push.sh) is extremely simple,
so if you don't trust me, you can examine it yourself.
